1. Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
    Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

2. Clarifications:
- How big is the nums array? size max. 1000
- How big are elements? Could they be negative? see constraints, yes
- How to handle empty array as input? Just return []
- Can I assume None is not passed as input?

3. Test Cases:

4. Approach1: Use naive approach traverse each element add and append to result
Time: O(N) to traverse nums
Space: O(N) to save the resulting array
