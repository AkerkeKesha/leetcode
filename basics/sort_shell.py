"""
In insertion sort, we move many elements. The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items.
In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h.
We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1.
An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
